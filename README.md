# Interview Homework


## Problem 1

### Scenario
Due to data requirements, developers need to spin up application and database instances in a special AWS account to be able to test their code.  In order to contain costs, the SRE team needs to keep track of how many instances are running at any given time to make sure that we do not cross certain cost thresholds.

### Requirement
Create a Lambda function that returns the number of EC2 Instances running in an account that have a specific tag.

### Instructions
Fork this repo to your personal GitHub account.  After you have completed your function, email a link to your repository for review (an address will be provided to you).

## What You Will Need
1.  A GitHub account
2.  AWS Account
